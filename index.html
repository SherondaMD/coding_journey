            <em>Once upon a time...</em> <br />
            <br />there was a woman that thought learning how to code was a fun
            thing to dream about. Picturing, learning all about computers and
            channeling her inner Penelope Garcia! <br />
            <br />(IYKYK!) <br /><br />She was sure though, that she would never
            understand how to code. üôÅ What she was doing wrong...for her, was
            trying to self start without any idea of <strong> where </strong>to
            start.
          </h3>
          <h2>How it happened</h2>
          <h3>
            One day she was looking through the pages of LinkedIn, and she came
            across a SheCodes coding workshops for Women, post. She wondered if
            this was the ticket to her learning how to code. She made a mental
            note to check out the website and only after coming across three
            additional posts...she took it as a sign to check it out
            immediately. She joined one of the 60-minute introductory classes.
            ü§ì
            <p />
            Wow! It seemed to make so much sense to her, so why not fully give
            it a try. Either your code worked...or it didn't, and if it
            didn't...figure out how to make it work! She then signed up for the
            most basic class that she could take.
            <p />
            üéá Imaging her suprise, when it not only made sense but she was able
            to utilize what she learned to help her 9-5 job. She proposed taking
            the full SheCodes course to her manager, and her manager was 110%
            behind it! Thus began her long journey...
          </h3>
          <h2>How it's going</h2>
          <h3>
            5 long months passed, but she finished her courses and became
            certified as a Front-end Developer! She's never going to stop
            learning, and the prospect of having to learn more and more to keep
            up to date is exciting to her. Now she is looking to start a new
            career in tech as a developer while still looking for new things to
            learn about. The top three items on her list are - Python, React
            Native, and to begin her Full Stack studies.
