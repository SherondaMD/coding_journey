            time there was a woman that thought she would never understand how
            to code. üôÅ Learning always seemed too hard to start so she always
            paused before taking that giant step into learning.

        <h2>How it happened</h2>
        <h3>
          One day she was looking at LinkedIn, and she came across the SheCodes
          coding workshops for Women, link. She wondered if this was the ticket
          to her learning how to code. She gave it a shot, by joining one of the
          60-minute classes. ü§ì
          <p />
          Wow! It seemed to make so much sense to her, so why not fully give it
          a try. She then signed up for the most basic class that she could
          take. If she didn't feel like she understood the concepts outlined in
          the class this early on then she wouldn't continue.
          <p />
          üéá Imaging her suprise, when it not only made sense but she was able
          to utilize what she learned to help her 9-5 job. She proposed taking
          the full SheCodes course to her manager, and she was 110% behind it!
          Thus began her journey...

        <h2>How it's going</h2>
        <h3>
          She finished her courses in 5 months and became certified as a
          Front-end Developer. Now she is looking to start a new career in tech
          as a developer while still looking for new things to learn about. The
          top three items on her list are - Python, React Native, and to begin
          her Full Stack studies.
